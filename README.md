# F FB

A greasemonkey script to clean up facebook a bit. No sidebars, no "sponsored" or "suggested" posts.

## Tentative ideas for the future

- Make into an extension for chrome and firefox
- Add blacklist of words and screen posts containing them
- Scrape friends facebook pages and construct a timeline from their
content, bypassing the facebook algorithm (ambitious I know)
